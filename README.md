# Business Objective
The price of a house is based on several characteristics such as location, total area,
number of rooms, various amenities available, etc.
In this project, we will perform house price prediction for 200 apartments in Pune city.
Different regression models such as Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc., will be
implemented. Also, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models will be implemented using
scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
This house price prediction project will help you predict the price of houses based on
various features and house properties.
Data Description
We are given a real estate dataset with around 200 rows and 17 different variables that
play an important role in predicting our target variable, i.e., price.
Aim
The goal is to predict sale prices for homes in Pune city.
Tech stack
⮚ Language - Python
⮚ Libraries - sklearn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost
Approach
1. Data Cleaning
● Importing the required libraries and reading the dataset.
● Preliminary exploration
● Check for the outliers and remove outliers.
● Dropping of redundant feature columns
● Missing value handling
● Regularizing the categorical columns
● Save the cleaned data
2. Data Analysis
● Import the required libraries and read the cleaned dataset.
● Converting binary columns to dummy variables
● Feature Engineering
● Univariate and Bivariate analysis
● Check for correlation
● Feature selection
● Data Scaling
● Saving the final updated dataset
3. Model Building
● Data preparation
● Performing train test split
● Linear Regression
● Ridge Regression
● Lasso Regressor
● Elastic Net
● Random Forest Regressor
● XGBoost Regressor
● K-Nearest Neighbours Regressor
● Support Vector Regressor
4. Model Validation
● Mean Squared Error
● R2 score
● Plot for residuals
5. Performs the grid search and cross-validation for the given regressor
6. Fitting the model and making predictions on the test data
7. Checking for Feature Importance
8. Model comparisons.
9. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) Models
● MLP Regression with scikit-learn
● Regression with TensorFlow
Modular code overview
Once you unzip the modular_code.zip file, you can find the following folders within it.
● input
● src
● output
● lib
1. Input folder - It contains all the data that we have for analysis.
● Real_Estate Data.xlsx
2. Src folder - This is the most important folder of the project. This folder
contains all the modularized code for all the above steps in a modularized
manner. This folder consists of:
● engine.py
● ML_Pipeline
The ML_pipeline is a folder that contains all the functions put into different
python files, which are appropriately named. These python functions are then
called inside the engine.py file.
3. Output folder – The output folder contains the best-fitted model that we
trained for this data. This model can be easily loaded and used for future use,
and the user need not have to train all the models from the beginning.
Note: This model is built over a chunk of data. One can obtain the model for
the entire data by running engine.py by taking the entire data to train the
models.
4. Lib folder - This is a reference folder. It contains the original ipython notebook
that we saw in the videos.
5. The requirements.txt file has all the required libraries with respective versions.
Kindly install the file by using the command pip install -r requirements.txt
6. All the instructions for running the code are present in the readme.MD file
